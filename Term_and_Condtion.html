                  Supreme Court of India in the case of Dr. K.R. Lakshmanan vs. State of Tamil Nadu And Anr on
                  12 January, 1996 (1996) AIR 1153, 1996 SCC(2) 226 wherein the word Games of Skill has clearly
                  been stated which is reproduced as under,“A game of skill, on the other hand- although the
                  element of chance necessarily cannot be eliminated is one in which success depends principally upon
                  the
                  superior knowledge, training attention, experience and adroitness of the player. Golf, chess
                  and even Rummy are considered to be games of skill. The Courts have reasoned that there are few
                  games, if any, which consists purely of chance or skill, and as such games of chance is one in
                  which the element of chance predominates over the element of skill, and a game of skill is one in
                  which the element of skill predominates over the element of chance. It is dominant element – “skill”
                  or “chance” – which determines the character of the game”.
